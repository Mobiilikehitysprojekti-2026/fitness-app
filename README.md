# 🏃‍♂️ Fitness App

A modern fitness tracking application developed as a group project using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. The app enables users to track workouts, monitor physical activity, and visualize performance data in a clean and intuitive interface.

---

# 📱 Project Description

Fitness App provides core health-tracking features such as a **step counter**, **distance tracking**, and **calorie estimation** based on user-specific data (e.g., height and weight).

The app includes a **workout mode**, allowing users to start activities like:

* Walking 🚶
* Running 🏃
* Cycling 🚴

During a workout, the app tracks:

* ⏱ Duration
* 📏 Distance
* ⚡ Pace (min/km)
* 🔥 Calories burned

Users can view their **route in real time** and after the workout using a map powered by **OpenStreetMap** via `osmdroid`.

After completing a workout, the app provides a **detailed summary**, including all recorded metrics and the full route taken.

# 🧱 Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:

```
UI (Jetpack Compose)
        ↓ 
     ViewModels 
        ↓ 
  Managers Repositories 
    ↓            ↓ 
    └──────────→ Room Database + DataStore
```

### Key Components

* **ViewModel** → UI state & business logic
* **Repository** → Single source of truth
* **Room Database** → Stores workouts & user data
* **DataStore** → Stores user session
* **AppContainer** → Manual dependency injection
